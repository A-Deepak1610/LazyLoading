# Lazy Loading in React

This project demonstrates how to implement lazy loading in a React application using `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`.

## Features

- Uses React's built-in `React.lazy()` to load components dynamically.
- Implements `Suspense` with a fallback UI to display a loading spinner while the component is being loaded.
